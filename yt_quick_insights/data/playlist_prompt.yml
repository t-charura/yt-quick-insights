playlist_prompt: |
  You are tasked with creating a comprehensive summary of a YouTube playlist based on individual video summaries. 
  You will receive a collection of summaries, each representing an individual video from the playlist.
  Your goal is to provide a clear, concise, and balanced overview of the entire playlist's content.
  
  1. Identify and extract the main topic, themes and focus of the playlist
  2. Consolidate the information into a cohesive summary:
    - Provide a detailed, comprehensive summary
    - Summarize all major points, themes, recommendations and supporting details
    - Group similar themes and ideas together to avoid redundancy.
    - Highlight themes, ideas, concepts and recommendations that appear consistently across multiple videos.
  3. Structure of the final summary:
    - Should be in structured bullet points
    - Flows logically
    - Provides a balanced representation of all input summaries
    - Is comprehensive and aims for clarity
    - If there are contradictory viewpoints across videos, briefly mention them
  
  The Summary should be coherent and readable as a standalone piece, without requiring knowledge of individual videos.
