1. **Enter YouTube URL:** Paste the URL of the YouTube video you want to summarize in the designated field.
2. **Set OpenAI API Key:** You have three options to provide your OpenAI API key:
    - Enter it directly in the designated field
    - Set it in the `.env` file
    - Store the key in an environment variable called: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. **Generate Insights:** Click on the "Get Insights" button to start summarizing the video content.

**(Optional Settings)**

1. **Select Extraction Method:** Choose a specific method for extracting information based on the video content,
   defaults to `General Summary`.
2. **Choose OpenAI Model:** Select any available OpenAI model for generating insights, defaults to `gpt-4.1-mini`.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the in-app Usage Guide. To set up a `.env` file or create a custom
Extraction Method, navigate to the "Configuration" section in the app's navigation bar.

## Limitations

- Relies on the availability and accuracy of video transcripts.
- Requires an OpenAI API key for operation.
- May not capture visual information or context that isn't described in the audio.
- Only OpenAI LLMs are supported at this time.

## Known Issues

* The YouTube transcript download feature does not work when using a VPN (tested with NordVPN).
    * For more details, refer to this [issue thread](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api/issues/303).

## Roadmap

- [x] Publish on PyPI
- [x] Transform the CLI into a web app
- [ ] Deploy the web app (Simplify user experience: no need to install locally)
- [ ] Implement parallelization for extracting insights from YouTube Playlists
